Hi!
Thanks for checking out my project.

IMPORTANT!!
Please note that this server is currently designed for personal use only, it can be easily tweaked for public use however.
Passwords are currently NOT encrypted, this is purposeful. If there is a public build they will obviously be hashed.

This server was designed in xampp using its copy of mysql, attempting to just 'npm start' the project will fail.
I may change it to something like Mongo or Firebase in the future, but honestly I prefer mysql cause I like the way it looks/feels.

The discord bot will only be function if/when the rest of the site is.


ALSO

You may notice there's a file folder, which actually contains the served files. This is only this way because I built the site on my desktop, and its not yet tweaked for my server machine.
